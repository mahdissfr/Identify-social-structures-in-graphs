This is my data structure's final project.
The goal of this project is to implement a graph-related algorithm. This algorithm was introduced in 2004 and detects social structures in a graph. By performing experiments on the implementation of this algorithm, the amount of memory consumed and runtime should be calculated for graphs of different sizes. Also, the effect of different sorting algorithms on time and memory consumption must be calculated.
]n this project adjacency list and adjacency matrix are implemented for the graph which is read from the text files and then it's sorted with quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, insertion sort in order to compare the speed(time) and memory that each of the sorting algorithms and the two different graph storing data structures( Matrix and List ) take.
The project introduction is attached. [its in persian]
